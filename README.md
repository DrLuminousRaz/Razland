ICT171 - Introduction to Server Environments and Architectures Cloud Server Project
In this assignment, you will build an online server, accessible via a domain name, in the cloud. 
 
You are encouraged to consider this server as a long term proposition and something that you could continue to develop as you progress throughout your degree. Some ideas include: 
● A personal Internet presence that showcases your experience and technical capabilities throughout your degree. 
● An Internet presence for a club you belong to, a volunteer group or a charity. 
● If you are currently employed, consider developing a server that might be of value to your organisation or a prototype for a service that might be used in the future. 
 
If you have the skills, we would encourage you to extend the server past whatever you have learnt in the labs. Some examples include: an FTP server, A Mail server, Wikimedia, Wordpress, IRC server. You are not limited to these ideas, feel free to make the server whatever you want and document the process. We are also keen for students to show us that they are capable of learning independently. There is a scripting component where you can show some creativity. There are also additional marks for students that implement their server in Digital Ocean or Azure.
